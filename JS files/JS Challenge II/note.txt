1. Invertory Tracker

    Output:
    apple: 10  
    banana: 15  
    cherry: 5  
    date: 20  
    elderberry: 7  

    This code pairs each fruits and date with its corresponding count,
    The loop moves through both arrays together, 
    printing each fruits and date name followed by its stock count.


2. Alphabetical Sorting

    output:
    ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'mango', 'zebra']

    This code sorts the list of words alphabetically. 
    It goes through the list, comparing each word with the others, 
    and swaps them if they are out of order.


3. Unique Array Builder

    output:
    [10, 2, 3, 5, 14, 7, 12, 8, 13, 6]

    On this code it produce 10 unique random numbers between 1 and 20.
    Start with an empty list (uniqueNumbers = []).
    it Keeps picking a random number between 1 and 20.
    Before adding, check if the number already exists in the list.
    If it’s new, add it. If it’s already there, pick another.
    Repeat until we have 10 unique numbers.
    Print the final list of numbers.

4. Triangle Checker

    output:
    The sides 7, 10, and 5 form a valid triangle.

    On this code it checks the three given sides that can form a valid triangle.
    To make a triangle it should sum of the any two sides must be greater than the third side:
    sideA + sideB > sideC
    sideB + sideC > sideA
    sideA + sideC > sideB
    If all three conditions are true, the sides form a valid triangle. If even one condition fails, it's not a triangle.
