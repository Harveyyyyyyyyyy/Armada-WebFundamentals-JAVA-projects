		<h2> Why I love video games</h2>
		<p>The main reason I enjoy playing video games is that they allow me to live through various stories and environments that other forms of entertainment cannot match. Every moment from sunrise to sunset is full of opportunities to make fun and learn because games provide endless ways to have fun and learn. I solve problems differently in video games, they inspire my creativity and not infrequently show me real-life values like persistence, teamwork, and planning. It also serves as a great way to relax and not think about the stress we have in our daily lives.</p>
		<p>There are hundreds of reasons why I enjoy video games and one of them is the interaction aspect. I have some of the best times with my friends whether we play together online or offline, we always have a lot of laughter and work as a team. It feels like single-player games are so personal because they allow me to walk in the shoes of different people and feel what they feel through their stories. They attract people, generate creativity and are a form of self-expression that make them such a big part of my life.</p>
